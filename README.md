Advent of Code 2019
===================
This year I want to learn several new languages and this seems like a good 
opportunity to do so!

Languages
---------
After using Ada and Crystal for the first two days I decided it would be fun to
keep using new languages.

1. Ada (GNAT 8.3.0)
2. Crystal (0.31.1)
3. Fortran 95 (GFortan 8.3.0)
4. x86 (NASM 2.14)
5. ALGOL 68 (Algol68G 2.8.4)
6. COBOL (GnuCOBOL 2.2.0)
7. APL (GNU APL)
8. BASIC (FreeBASIC)
9. Forth (FreeForth2)
10. Pascal (Free Pascal)
11. Smalltalk (GNU Smalltalk)
12. Prolog (SWI-Prolog)
13. TeX (TeX Live)
14. AWK (GNU Awk 4.2.1)
15. PostScript (any PDF viewer)
16. Haskell
17. OCaml
18. Dlang
19. Adga
20. Nim
21. Idris
22. Elixir
23. Elm
24. Julia
25. Raku

After a while I decided to write down one thing I like and one thing I dislike
about each language. This only represents the experience I gained from solving
one problem in that language (and doesn't characterize my opinion about the
whole language).

1. Ada
   * like: `:=` for assignments (more mathematical and frees `=` for comparison)
   * dislike: no functional array utilities like `map` and `reduce`
2. Crystal
   * like: built-in list comparison with `<=>` (this is a common use-case)
   * dislike: unfamiliar closure syntax `{ |x| x + 1 }`
3. Fortran
   * like: `!` for comments (my brain is programmed to prioritize exclamations)
   * dislike: no dynamic string manipulation utilities
4. x86 assembly
   * like: now I can finally say I also did assembly once
   * dislike: historical register names like rsi, rdi (source/destination index)
5. ALGOL 68
   * like: feels almost like a modern language!
   * dislike: semicolon as infix operator
6. COBOL
   * like: built-in SEARCH statement is progressive (for its time)
   * dislike: data type system is not intuitive from todays perspective
